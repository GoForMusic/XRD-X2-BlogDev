    "content": "A list of Unity gizmos codesCode sample and editor displayThis has been used by me to easily build enemy AI patrol pathways.As you can see from the code, there may be times when you need to view a script. For this reason, the Gizmos commands are particularly helpful when you need to debug a function and for improved visualization within Unity.And in the visualization, I can see that the blue diamond at the beginning and the red diamond at the end of the patrol path, as well as the intermediary waypoints that are marked as white diamonds and the green Gizmos line, which may help us comprehend the route that the NPC AI would take.ResourcesYou may click on this link to learn more about the Gizmos Menu, and you can read this page from Unity to learn more about Gizmos commands."

    "content": "IntroductionVirtual reality, extended reality, augmented reality, mixed reality…These words are becoming increasingly common in the media, in talks with clients, and in conversations with colleagues. While some are quite informed about this technical arena, others are just getting started and want to know the fundamentals. If that describes you, here’s a quick rundown of the main phrases.eXtended Reality (XR)eXtended Reality (XR) is a catch-all word for any technologies that augment or replace your perspective of the world. All XR technologies increase our perception of reality by combining the virtual and’real’ worlds or by producing a completely immersive experience.XR is a catch-all word for Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR), and any future immersive technologies.Virtual Reality (VR)VR refers to a three-dimensional, computer-generated world that a person may explore and interact with. This individual is totally immersed in this virtual environment thanks to a VR headset or head-mounted display that provides a 360-degree picture of an artificial world. When combined with headphones, effective VR may fool your brain into believing you are entirely detached from your real surroundings.Many individuals are familiar with virtual reality through the usage of head-mounted devices such as the Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, or Google Cardboard.Pros and cons of VR            Pros      Cons                  Better than reality      High cost              Used in various fields      Communication should not be replaced for group of people              User have awesome experiences      Feeling of worthlessness              Gives detail views      Users addict to the virtual world              Connects with people remotly      Technology is still experimental              Effective communication      Training in VR environment is not real        VR may also cause motion sickness if the DEV did not properly configure the game/application.  Look through this article to learn more about the benefits and drawbacks of virtual reality.Augmented Reality (AR)Unlike VR, AR does not provide complete immersion. Instead, AR augments your vision of the actual world by superimposing computer-generated information such as images, text, and motion on top of what you see.This technique is now often utilized in smartphone augmented reality applications that require the user to hold their phone in front of them. The software may show contextual information that appears to be in the actual environment by capturing a picture from the camera and analyzing it in real time.Pokémon Go and Snapchat filters that place digital things such as hats or spectacles on your head are examples of AR experiences and games.Pros and cons of AR            Pros      Cons                  Enhanced Experience      High cost              Ease of Use      Assaults Confidentiality              Social Interaction      Accidental Situations              Learning and Practice      Addiction              Improved Technology      Psychological Effects        Look at this page to learn more about the AR’s benefits and drawbacks.Mixed Reality (MR)MR (also known as mixed reality) is the most recent immersive technology. MR is a hybrid of AR and VR that combines the actual and virtual worlds through holograms, immersive projections, and other means.In MR, digital material is superimposed in real time with the user’s environment. Unlike with AR, however, virtual objects in MR act in every way as if they were present in the real world. They are, for example, concealed by physical items, their illumination is compatible with genuine light sources in the environment, and you may interact with digital things in any way you choose, such as spinning them around.While not as immersive as VR, MR must be watched through semi-transparent glasses or MR headsets fitted with a camera to record and show the user’s environment.Despite their high cost, MR devices are already having a real-world impact, with Case Western Reserve University in Ohio using the Hololens to teach anatomy to medical students.What use cases does XR have?      ONBOARDING AND TRAININGEmployee training and onboarding is a costly, time-consuming, and critical activity for any business. Immersive XR training experiences have the potential to alter the onboarding process for many businesses by providing workers with the unique ability to practice new skills in a secure, regulated, yet realistic environment. Experts may also communicate with trainees in many places at the same time, offering businesses an advantage in the competitive world of global talent development.        SALES AND CUSTOMER SERVICEAs customers seek more tailored and complete customer experiences, XR has emerged as an unrivaled means of showcasing items. Shoppers may visit virtual storefronts, interact with digital representations of things whose actual counterparts are half a globe away, and even “try on” garments, which is a significant advance over scrolling through static photos on a webpage. Not only will this raise customer happiness, but it will also increase sales and decrease the amount of returns.        ONLINE COLLABORATIONXR may be used to enable remote collaboration, letting teams to collaborate virtually as if they were in the same physical area. This is especially beneficial for businesses with remote teams or those working in industries where face-to-face interactions are not possible. Traveling as little as possible saves time and money while also significantly lowering an organization’s carbon impact.In addition, XR promises to go much beyond the conventional video conference call in replicating the experience of face-to-face connection, encouraging more engaging, energetic, and intriguing meetings. In the sphere of education, the Rady School of Management at the University of California, San Diego has constructed a virtual campus complete with real-time lectures, breakout rooms, and outdoor areas.        DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGNXR is already transforming the design and development of both goods and processes. Product ideas may be iterated using detailed and interactive 3D representations instead of pricey physical prototypes and a collocated product team. Digital prototypes are also significantly more convenient to reuse, combine, and store.  XR meeting conference"

    "content": "This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the Chirpy template, and it’s worth reading even if you’ve used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.Naming and PathCreate a new file named YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION and put it in the _posts of the root directory. Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin Jekyll-Compose to accomplish this.Front MatterBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG]     # TAG names should always be lowercase---  The posts’ layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in the Front Matter block.Timezone of DateIn order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the post’s timezone in variable date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.Categories and TagsThe categories of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:---categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]---Author InformationThe author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the Front Matter , they will be obtained from variables social.name and the first entry of social.links of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:Adding author information in _data/authors.yml (If your website doesn’t have this file, don’t hesitate to create one).&lt;author_id&gt;:  name: &lt;full name&gt;  twitter: &lt;twitter_of_author&gt;  url: &lt;homepage_of_author&gt;And then use author to specify a single entry or authors to specify multiple entries:---author: &lt;author_id&gt;                     # for single entry# orauthors: [&lt;author1_id&gt;, &lt;author2_id&gt;]   # for multiple entries---Having said that, the key author can also identify multiple entries.  The benefit of reading the author information from the file _data/authors.yml is that the page will have the meta tag twitter:creator, which enriches the Twitter Cards and is good for SEO.Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post’s Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsThe global switch of comments is defined by variable comments.active in the file _config.yml. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:---comments: false---MathematicsFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---math: true---MermaidMermaid is a great diagrams generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:---mermaid: true---Then you can use it like other markdown languages: surround the graph code with ```mermaid and ```.ImagesCaptionAdd italics to the next line of an image，then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_SizeIn order to prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image.![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=\"700\" height=\"400\" }  For an SVG, you have to at least specify its width, otherwise it won’t be rendered.Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, height and width support abbreviations (height → h, width → w). The following example has the same effect as the above:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: w=\"700\" h=\"400\" }PositionBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes normal, left, and right.  Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added.      Normal position    Image will be left aligned in below sample:    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal }            Float to the left    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left }            Float to the right    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right }      Dark/Light modeYou can make images follow theme preferences in dark/light mode. This requires you to prepare two images, one for dark mode and one for light mode, and then assign them a specific class (dark or light):![Light mode only](/path/to/light-mode.png){: .light }![Dark mode only](/path/to/dark-mode.png){: .dark }ShadowThe screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }CDN URLIf you host the images on the CDN, you can save the time of repeatedly writing the CDN URL by assigning the variable img_cdn of _config.yml file:img_cdn: https://cdn.comOnce img_cdn is assigned, the CDN URL will be added to the path of all images (images of site avatar and posts) starting with /.For instance, when using images:![The flower](/path/to/flower.png)The parsing result will automatically add the CDN prefix https://cdn.com before the image path:&lt;img src=\"https://cdn.com/path/to/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Image PathWhen a post contains many images, it will be a time-consuming task to repeatedly define the path of the images. To solve this, we can define this path in the YAML block of the post:---img_path: /img/path/---And then, the image source of Markdown can write the file name directly:![The flower](flower.png)The output will be:&lt;img src=\"/img/path/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Preview ImageIf you want to add an image at the top of the post, please provide an image with a resolution of 1200 x 630. Please note that if the image aspect ratio does not meet 1.91 : 1, the image will be scaled and cropped.Knowing these prerequisites, you can start setting the image’s attribute:---image:  path: /path/to/image  alt: image alternative text---Note that the img_path can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the  attribute path only needs the image file name.For simple use, you can also just use image to define the path.---image: /path/to/image---LQIPFor preview images:---image:  lqip: /path/to/lqip-file # or base64 URI---For normal images:![Image description](/path/to/image){: lqip=\"/path/to/lqip-file\" }Pinned PostsYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:---pin: true---PromptsThere are several types of prompts: tip, info, warning, and danger. They can be generated by adding the class prompt-{type} to the blockquote. For example, define a prompt of type info as follows:&gt; Example line for prompt.{: .prompt-info }SyntaxInline Code`inline code part`Filepath Hightlight`/path/to/a/file.extend`{: .filepath}Code BlockMarkdown symbols ``` can easily create a code block as follows:```This is a plaintext code snippet.```Specifying LanguageUsing ```{language} you will get a code block with syntax highlight:```yamlkey: value```  The Jekyll tag {% highlight %} is not compatible with this theme.Line NumberBy default, all languages except plaintext, console, and terminal will display line numbers. When you want to hide the line number of a code block, add the class nolineno to it:```shellecho 'No more line numbers!'```{: .nolineno }Specifying the FilenameYou may have noticed that the code language will be displayed at the top of the code block. If you want to replace it with the file name, you can add the attribute file to achieve this:```shell# content```{: file=\"path/to/file\" }Liquid CodesIf you want to display the Liquid snippet, surround the liquid code with {% raw %} and {% endraw %}:{% raw %}```liquid{% if product.title contains 'Pack' %}  This product's title contains the word Pack.{% endif %}```{% endraw %}Or adding render_with_liquid: false (Requires Jekyll 4.0 or higher) to the post’s YAML block.VideosYou can embed a video with the following syntax:{% include embed/{Platform}.html id='{ID}' %}{% include embed/youtube.html id=’Balreaj8Yqs’ %}Where Platform is the lowercase of the platform name, and ID is the video ID.The following table shows how to get the two parameters we need in a given video URL, and you can also know the currently supported video platforms.            Video URL      Platform      ID                  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-B46URT4mg      youtube      H-B46URT4mg              https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1634779211      twitch      1634779211      Learn MoreFor more knowledge about Jekyll posts, visit the Jekyll Docs: Posts."
