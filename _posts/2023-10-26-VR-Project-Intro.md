This document contains an overview of the VR project, describing its motivation and describing its functional details.

## The motivation

Taking the idea from AR project (of using history as main objective) and also the educational game ["Who Wants to Be a Millionair?"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire%3F) we decide to create a similar game using the VR component and having fun while learning a bit of history.

## Subject

The chosen subject for VR project is History (from anctient till present)

## The idea

This idea could serve as a basis for designing a VR game that not only entertains players but also challenges their knowledge of history, fostering an engaging and competitive atmosphere within the VR environment.

As well the game will contain:
- **Progression**: With each correct answer,the player gets 100 score to the total score and will move to the next level. Wrong answers could result in dropping down 100 score but will remain on the same level until the player will get the right answer.
- **Graphics and Mechanics**: The game will run on VR set, allowing players to feel like theyâ€™re on the arena or a naturistic enviroment.The player will be able to use the enviroment in order to press the right pressure plate in order to get the right answer.
- **Questions and Levels**: The game consists of multiple levels, eatch level will represent a question from history

## Technology

For technology we will use XR fondation in order to use the VR set and we will use ChatGPT in order to generate the history questions.
