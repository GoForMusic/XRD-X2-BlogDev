## Adrian's Reflection

### What I did
I've worked with AR and VR technologies throughout the projects, expanding my expertise of those technologies and better understanding the Unity Engine.
Working developing the AR application, I discovered how important it is to connect something virtual to the real world and make it easy for the user to grasp.
I've additionally worked on the Temple scene, as well as in the city center with Marty and Marian, establishing a blacksmith area as authentically as feasible.
Another component I worked on in an AR project was the Text Canvas interaction, where I ran into a problem utilizing TextMeshPro, most likely due to the size of the Prefab, but using the old text managed to accomplish the same functionality, albeit with a much worse experience.

I was in responsible of putting up the game logic for the VR project, as well as connecting all of the "Core" to Marty's interaction plate and Marian's implementation of JSON and the Canvas element.

Aldo, throughout the testing process and finally to check how is made for the VR set, I was encountering some challenges with the Unity Build Settings, namely developing as an Android application within the VR rather than a VR game.

### What I enjoyed

I enjoyed seeing the projects in action, as well as seeing people attempt AR and VR games, finally learning something about Ancient Rome and general history. (This is an educational effort.)

### What I found difficult

I've found it tough to deal with AR projects in general, especially when a prefab needs to be downsized to fit better in the actual world.

And for the VR project, the main drawback was the lack of access to a VR set for development and testing.
In additional the permanent link with VR set wasn't working on my laptop.

### What really worked

In the end, both games worked and were presented, so I can conclude that both projects performed as expected, despite the fact that we spent more time designing and testing the AR project.

### In the future

Canvas should be a necessary for AR projects, as well as anything modular like constructing your own Prefab or scene and putting up extra elements for historical courses, specifically for the instructor to be able to prepare his content for the history class. (It is not essential to come from Ancient Rome.)

To make the VR project more participatory in the future, features like as 50-50, asking the public, and so on will be included.(similar to "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?")
Another innovation will be the ability to change the Scene area based on the subject of the questions, rather than only the historical one.
