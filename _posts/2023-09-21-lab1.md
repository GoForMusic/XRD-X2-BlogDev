During this week, we plan to gather some base/resources and develop a battle strategy this week in order to begin implementing.

Overall, the project should consist of a history presentation accompanied with actual, colorful cards. During the lecture, the facilitator may ask students to find a certain card and scan it with their phone. The soldier or a structure will appear enhanced on the card, and students can interact with it to study it. 

### Possible interactions
-   Press on an object and have a voice over or pop-up message (Depends on what the obj have, if it has voice over or any message stored)
-   Transforming the object (city) - scaling and rotating

### Narrative
There will be 3 buildings
- Roman template (Mars temple)
    -   Statue of Mars
    -   People
    -   Offerings to the gods (fish,fruits,etc..)
-   City center
    -   Soldiers
    -   Officers (Centurion)
    -   Peasants 
    -   Food Market
    -   Weapon Market (Roman auxiliary, Gladiator, Athens, Macedonian, Persian, Spartan, legionnaire)
    -   Clothes market
    -   Pottery market
    -   Statues
    -   Blacksmith
    -   Flags
    -   Bakery
    -   Construction site

We're also discussing how the prefab's mobile behavior should be, as well as various jobs and who will work and spend more time there.
