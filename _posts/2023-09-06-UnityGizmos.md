## Code sample and editor display

This has been used by me to easily build enemy AI patrol pathways.

As you can see from the code, there may be times when you need to view a script. For this reason, the Gizmos commands are particularly helpful when you need to debug a function and for improved visualization within Unity.

And in the visualization, I can see that the **blue diamond** at the beginning and the **red diamond** at the end of the patrol path, as well as the intermediary waypoints that are marked as **white diamonds** and the green Gizmos line, which may help us comprehend the route that the NPC AI would take.
